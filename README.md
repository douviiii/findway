# üó∫Ô∏è FindWay - Real-Time Navigation App (Android + Jetpack Compose)

**FindWay** is a real-time navigation app built using **Jetpack Compose**, **Google Maps SDK**, and **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture. The app allows users to:

- Search for locations using autocomplete
- Select any point on the map
- View address details in a bottom sheet
- Tap a button to fetch route directions
- See a live route updated in real-time as the user moves

This project is built to demonstrate modern **Android development practices** with a focus on **clean architecture**, **reactive state management** using `StateFlow`, and **location-based services**.

## üß© Architecture Overview

- **UI Layer** (`Mapping.kt`): 
  - Composable map screen with GoogleMap composable
  - Responds to state from ViewModel
  - Displays markers, polylines, and search/autocomplete

- **ViewModel (`MapViewModel.kt`)**:
  - Holds app state: current location, destination, route
  - Triggers real-time location updates
  - Fetches suggestions, directions, and decodes polylines

- **State Management**:
  - `StateFlow` is used for observable states like:
    - `currentLocation`
    - `selectedLocation`
    - `routePoints`
    - `suggestions`

- **Location & Network Layer**:
  - Uses FusedLocationProvider for location tracking
  - Google Directions API for routing
  - Places API for search autocomplete
